        <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Work on the go, no matter where you are, no matter what device you use</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> Creating you Sink OS account means that you can sign in anywhere on any device <b>Securely.</b> Let's say you were making an essay on Airplanes on a desktop but have to go somewhere. By using your Sink OS account, you can save that file, take your handheld (iPad, Phone ect.ect.) and work on that same file. And once you're home, hit the Save button on your device, and open your desktop, the recent changes will be saved and you can get back into it with your desktop</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: right;">Security, Had always been a priority, Always is a priority and Always <b>will be</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> Sink OS doesn't compromise on safety. In the URL for Sink OS, you will see Https, This stands for <b>Hyper text transfer protocol Secure.</b> This means that no matter what you do your data will always be encrypted. </p>

        <br>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Here is how it works</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> The way it works is rather simple. The user (you) creates an account. once created, until the user (you) decides to either change accounts, or deletes the account entirely. It will be saved both locally and within Sink OS's encypted servers. So in the scenario that you get signed out on your own device, you will be logged in significantly quicker becuase the account and password is saved locally, instead of getting an API to go fetch it from the servers </p>
